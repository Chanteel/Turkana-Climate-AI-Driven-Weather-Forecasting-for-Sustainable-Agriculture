# Turkana-Climate-AI-Driven-Weather-Forecasting-for-Sustainable-Agriculture
This project is developed to solve the sdg 2: Zero hunger.
Turkana Climate is an AI-driven weather forecasting project designed to address the agricultural challenges faced by farmers in Turkana County, Kenya.
This region experiences unpredictable rainfall, frequent droughts, and high temperatures, which significantly impact agricultural productivity. 
Our solution leverages advanced machine learning techniques to provide localized, accurate, and timely weather forecasts to improve decision-making and enhance agricultural outcomes.

# Shiny App
The project includes a Shiny app that simulates weather stations and generates weather data, trains machine learning models, and provides visualizations and predictions.

> The key features include:

    > Simulated Weather Stations: Generates weather data for multiple stations (Lodwar, Kakuma, Lokichar, Lokitaung, Kalokol).
    > Weather Data Generation: Simulates temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall data.
    > Machine Learning Models: Utilizes linear regression and ensemble techniques for weather prediction.
    > Interactive Visualizations: Provides plots for temperature, rainfall, and wind speed over time.
    > Leaflet Map: Displays weather station locations on an interactive map.
    > Data Tables: Shows real-time and historical weather data.
    > SMS Integration: Logs SMS alerts for weather updates.
